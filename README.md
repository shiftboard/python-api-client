# Shiftboard Python API Client

This is a Python-based set of libraries for interacting with the API service
for [Shiftboard](https://shiftboard.com). The libraries may be used directly, or as an example for
developing custom code using data from Shiftboard.

To make use of these client libraries, you will need an active account on
[Shiftboard](https://shiftboard.com), and will need to have an API Access Key and Signature Key
enabled in your account.
